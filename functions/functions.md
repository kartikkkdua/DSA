# ðŸ“˜ Functions in Java

In **Java** (and programming in general), **functions** (also called **methods** in Java) are blocks of code designed to perform a specific task. You can call a function whenever you need to perform that task, which helps reduce code repetition and increases modularity.

## ðŸ”¹ What is a Function (Method) in Java?

A function:
- âœ… Has a name  
- âœ… Can accept input values (called **parameters**)  
- âœ… Can return a value (or not)  
- âœ… Is reusable and can be called multiple times

## ðŸ”§ Structure of a Java Function

```java
<access_modifier> <return_type> <function_name>(<parameters>) {
    // code block
    return value; // optional
}
